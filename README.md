# Project-Autonomous-Vehicles

Despite the popularity of autonomous vehicles, the robustness of these vehicles degrades when operating in the rural areas or new environments. To address this challenge, your task is to build an AI system that has the following capabilities during the vehicle navigation: (1) detect known objects in the video; (2) detect novel objects in the video; and (3) make decisions to avoid collisions on the road. Note that the second and third capabilities are crucial for any autonomous vehicle to improve its robustness.
